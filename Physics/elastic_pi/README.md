# Approximate Pi with elastic collision

## Motivation

* This work is inspired by [3Blue1Brown](https://youtu.be/HEfHFsfGXjs)
* Original paper by Gregory Galperin: [Playing pool with pi](https://www.maths.tcd.ie/~lebed/Galperin.%20Playing%20pool%20with%20pi.pdf)

## Description

* This code calculate the number of perfect elastic collisions between 1kg mass object and 100^d kg mass object.
* The number of collisions corresponds to effective number of pi.
* Code shows all steps. If you don't want to see procedures, then you can comment out the line of print.
